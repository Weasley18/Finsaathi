HACK-A-LEAGUE 4.0Project Proposal & Technical BlueprintFinSaathiAI-Powered Personal Finance Assistant for Underserved Communities"Your Money. Your Future. Simplified."Theme: Ignite the Future   |   Verticals: AI/ML · E-commerce & FinTech · Cybersecurity (RBAC)Global Academy of Technology, Bengaluru  ·  February 21–22, 2026Executive SummaryOver 500 million Indians are either unbanked or underbanked. First-time earners, gig workers, daily-wage laborers, and rural users lack access to intelligent, personalized financial guidance. Existing fintech apps target the already-financially-literate urban demographic and are inaccessible due to complexity, language barriers, and the assumption of prior financial knowledge.FinSaathi bridges this gap with a multilingual, AI-first personal finance assistant that speaks your user's language, literally. It combines a fine-tuned open-source LLM, real-time spending analytics, behavioral nudges, micro-investment recommendations, and a secure role-based access control architecture to serve four distinct user personas: End Users, Financial Advisors, Partner Institutions, and Admins.Theme Alignment: 'Ignite the Future' — FinSaathi ignites financial futures for millions left behind by conventional banking and fintech, using cutting-edge AI to democratize wealth-building knowledge.PART 1 — UI/UX Design PhilosophyFinSaathi is designed with a single, non-negotiable visual principle: premium should not mean exclusive. The interface must feel aspirational to a first-time smartphone user while remaining deeply intuitive. The design language is Liquid Glass — a contemporary aesthetic that Apple popularized and that signifies sophistication, transparency, and fluidity.1.1  The Liquid Glass Design LanguageLiquid Glass is a UI philosophy built on the interplay of translucency, depth, soft reflections, and smooth motion. Every surface in FinSaathi behaves as if it is made of frosted, slightly curved glass — catching ambient light, blurring content beneath it, and responding to touch with subtle elastic animations. The result is a UI that feels alive and regal without being cluttered or aggressive. The Royal theme — deep burgundy, warm gold, and crimson red against rich parchment white — evokes the gravitas of established wealth while remaining accessible to first-time users.
Liquid Glass is a UI philosophy built on the interplay of translucency, depth, soft reflections, and smooth motion. Every surface in FinSaathi behaves as if it is made of frosted, slightly curved glass — catching ambient light, blurring content beneath it, and responding to touch with subtle elastic animations. The result is a UI that feels alive and regal without being cluttered or aggressive. The Royal theme — deep burgundy, warm gold, and crimson red against rich parchment white — evokes the gravitas of established wealth while remaining accessible to first-time users.Core Visual Principles • Glassmorphism Cards — All dashboard cards, modals, and bottom sheets use backdrop-filter: blur(24px) with a background of rgba(253,246,227,0.12) on dark burgundy surfaces and rgba(253,246,227,0.80) on light parchment surfaces. Cards have a 1px border with rgba(212,175,55,0.4) to simulate gold-edged glass. • Layered Depth — The UI operates on a Z-axis concept. Background layers hold the ambient royal gradient mesh, mid-layers hold glass cards with gold-tinted edges, and top layers hold actionable controls. This creates a sense of palatial depth. • Fluid Micro-Animations — All transitions use spring physics (stiffness: 300, damping: 20). Spending charts animate in with a draw effect; notification badges pulse in gold; bottom navigation icons morph on selection using Lottie animations. • Ambient Gradient Mesh Background — The app background is a slowly shifting gradient mesh in deep burgundy (#1C0A00), dark gold (#B8860B), and royal crimson (#C0392B) — the FinSaathi Royal palette. This gradient animates at 0.3° per second creating a living, breathing canvas reminiscent of royal brocade. • Typography — Two-font system: Cormorant Garamond (elegant serif with royal character) for headings and display text; Inter for body text. Both are open-source via Google Fonts. Font sizes follow an 8pt modular scale (12 / 14 / 16 / 20 / 24 / 32 / 40 / 56). • Haptic Feedback — Every critical interaction (transaction confirmed, budget limit reached, savings goal hit) triggers a distinct haptic pattern on mobile, reinforcing the tactile premium feel.Color SystemTokenHex ValueUsagePrimary Burgundy#1C0A00App backgrounds, dark surfaces, navbarsDark Gold#B8860BCTAs, active states, gold borders, chart accentsRoyal Crimson#C0392BAlerts, badges, secondary actions, error statesBright Gold#D4AF37Card border glow, icon highlights, dividersParchment White#FDF6E3Card backgrounds (light mode), primary surfaceIvory White#FFFDF7Alternating table rows, input backgroundsSurface Dark Glassrgba(28,10,0,0.75)Glass card background on dark surfaces

It adapts fluidly from 320px mobile widths to 4K desktop displays using a 12-column CSS Grid system.Dashboard Layout (Desktop) • Left Sidebar (240px) — Deep burgundy (#1C0A00) glass-surface navigation panel with collapsible labels. Gold (#D4AF37) active indicator line on selected items. Contains avatar with gold ring, role badge in crimson, and primary nav items with Lottie icon animations. • Main Content Area — Three-column bento grid at 1280px+ breakpoint. Cards are parchment-white glassmorphic surfaces with box-shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(212,175,55,0.20) — a subtle gold ambient glow. • Right Panel (320px) — AI Chat Assistant drawer with parchment (#FDF6E3) background and gold-bordered input. Slides in from the right over the main content with a warm-tinted glass blur overlay. • Top Bar — Frosted parchment glass strip (blur: 20px, background: rgba(253,246,227,0.85)) with greeting in Cormorant Garamond, global search with gold focus ring, crimson notification bell badge, and dark/light mode toggle.Dashboard Layout (Mobile) • Bottom Navigation Bar — Deep burgundy glass bar with gold-highlighted active tab. Gold line indicator above active icon. Center FAB is a gold (#D4AF37) circle with crimson icon for quick expense entry. • Swipeable Card Stack — Spending summary, savings goals, and AI insights presented as horizontally swipeable parchment-glass cards with gold-border edges at the top of the home screen. • Pull-to-Refresh — Custom liquid gold ripple animation from pull point replaces the standard spinner. • Bottom Sheet Modals — Parchment white bottom sheets with a gold drag handle pill and crimson close button. Spring animation on open/dismiss.
 • Bottom Sheet Modals — Parchment white bottom sheets with a gold drag handle pill and crimson close button. Spring animation on open/dismiss.1.3  Mobile Application (React Native)The mobile app shares the same design system and component library as the web app via a shared Storybook-documented component package. Platform-specific implementations: • iOS — Uses SwiftUI BlurView bridged via React Native for native-level glass effects on parchment surfaces. Follows Human Interface Guidelines for gesture handling. • Android — Uses RenderEffect API (Android 12+) for backdrop blur over the royal burgundy base. Falls back to a semi-transparent parchment overlay with subtle gold-noise texture for Android 11 and below. • Shared — Reanimated 3 for all animations, React Navigation 6 with custom gold-accent glass tab bar, Skia canvas for chart rendering in gold/crimson palette.1.4  Onboarding ExperienceFirst impressions determine retention, especially with first-time users. FinSaathi's onboarding is designed as a conversational flow, not a form: • Screen 1 — Animated splash: royal burgundy background with a slowly rotating gold gradient mesh. FinSaathi logo in Cormorant Garamond fades in with a golden shimmer effect. • Screen 2 — Language selection presented as large, tactile gold-bordered glass chips on parchment white (12 Indian languages supported from day one). • Screen 3 — WhatsApp or Mobile Number sign-in. Input field with gold focus ring and crimson CTA button. No email required, reducing friction for non-technical users. • Screen 4 — AI-guided 3-question financial profiling: income range (gold gradient slider), primary goal (crimson-active chips), existing savings (toggle). No intimidating forms. • Screen 5 — Personalized dashboard generated instantly. The user sees their AI advisor's first message in a gold-bordered chat bubble waiting for them.PART 2 — Feature Architecture by User RoleFinSaathi operates on a four-tier Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model. Each role has strictly scoped permissions managed by a middleware layer on the backend. The RBAC implementation uses the casbin open-source library with a policy.csv model stored in PostgreSQL.RBAC Architecture: Subject (Who) → Resource (What) → Action (How). Policies are enforced at the API gateway level using casbin-node middleware. No role can escalate its own privileges. All permission changes are audit-logged.RoleDescription & ScopeEND USERLow-income individual, gig worker, first-time earner.

Full system access with mandatory 2FA and audit trail.2.1  End User — Feature Set2.1.1  AI-Powered Chat Financial Advisor (Core Feature)The heart of FinSaathi is a conversational AI built on a fine-tuned Mistral-7B-Instruct model, hosted locally or via Ollama on the backend server. The model is fine-tuned on Indian personal finance data to understand local context: SIPs, PPF, chit funds, MSME lending, UPI fraud patterns, and regional income categories. • Model: Llama 8B (Apache 2.0 License) — fine-tuned using QLoRA on a custom dataset assembled from RBI guidelines, SEBI investor education material, and synthetic Q&A pairs generated using GPT-4o for bootstrap (then distilled). • Fine-tuning Framework: Hugging Face PEFT + TRL (SFTTrainer). Training run on Google Colab A100 (free tier) or Kaggle GPU. Model weights saved to Hugging Face Hub (free). • Serving: Ollama (open-source, MIT license) on the backend server. Supports streaming token output for real-time chat feel. • MCP (Model Context Protocol): Implemented using Anthropic's open-source MCP specification. The LLM is given structured tool calls — get_user_balance, get_recent_transactions, get_investment_portfolio, get_market_data. The model decides which tools to call based on the user's query, retrieves live data, and synthesizes a grounded, factual response. This prevents hallucination of financial figures. • RAG Pipeline: User's financial documents (salary slips, bank statements uploaded as PDF) are chunked, embedded using sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (free, HuggingFace), and stored in a Chroma vector database (Apache 2.0). The LLM retrieves relevant chunks before answering queries about the user's own financial situation. • Multilingual Support: IndicTrans2 (open-source, AI4Bharat) translates user input to English before the LLM processes it, then translates the response back. Supports Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Marathi, and 5 more.2.1.2  Intelligent Expense Tracking • SMS Parsing: An on-device NLP model (fine-tuned DistilBERT, 66MB) reads bank SMS notifications with user permission. Extracts merchant, amount, category, and timestamp. No raw SMS ever leaves the device. • UPI Deep-Link Integration: Detects UPI payment completions from GPay, PhonePe, Paytm via Android intent listeners and iOS URL scheme callbacks. Auto-logs transactions. • Manual Entry with AI Assist: User types or speaks a transaction ('spent 200 on chai and samosa at the dhaba'). A Named Entity Recognition model extracts: amount=200, category=Food, merchant=dhaba. One-tap confirmation. • Receipt OCR: Camera capture of physical receipts. Parsed using Tesseract OCR (Apache 2.0) + a post-processing DistilBERT model for field extraction (total, merchant, date, items).
 • Receipt OCR: Camera capture of physical receipts. Parsed using Tesseract OCR (Apache 2.0) + a post-processing DistilBERT model for field extraction (total, merchant, date, items). • Auto-Categorization: XGBoost classifier trained on 50,000+ Indian transaction descriptions from open datasets. 23 expense categories including Autorickshaw, Festival, Pooja, and EMI — categories relevant to Indian users.2.1.3  AI Budget Planner & Spending Insights • 50/30/20 Adaptive Rule: The AI adjusts the classic budgeting rule based on the user's income tier. For users below ₹15,000/month, it applies a 60/20/20 rule (more for needs). Explained in plain language with local examples. • Anomaly Detection: Isolation Forest model (scikit-learn) flags unusual spending — e.g., 'You spent 3x your usual food budget this week. Was there a special occasion?' This doubles as a soft fraud detection layer. • Spending Forecast: Prophet (Meta, open-source) time-series model forecasts month-end spending based on first-week patterns. Displayed as a glass-morphic projection chart with confidence intervals. • Category Drill-Down: Tap any spending category to see an itemized glass card list with merchant logos (fetched from Clearbit Logo API, free tier), amounts, and AI-generated observation (e.g., 'You visit this medical store every 2 weeks. Consider buying in bulk to save ₹180/month.').2.1.4  Savings Goal Engine • Goal Templates: Pre-built goal templates for Indian life events — Wedding, Home Down Payment, Child's Education, Emergency Fund, Festival Shopping. Each has a localized AI-generated savings plan. • Micro-Savings Automation: Round-up feature: every UPI transaction is rounded up to the nearest ₹10, and the difference is swept to a savings pocket. User can set rule: 'Save ₹5 every time I spend on food delivery.' • Gamification Layer: Savings streaks, milestone badges (Gold-foil glass badge cards animate in with a crimson confetti particle burst), and a community leaderboard (opt-in, anonymized). Behavioral economics nudges — loss aversion framing ('You're ₹500 away from losing your 30-day streak') proven to improve savings adherence. • Goal Progress Visualization: Circular progress ring with liquid fill animation (Skia canvas). Color transitions from crimson red at 0–40% to bright gold at 100%, symbolizing the journey from struggle to royalty.2.1.5  Micro-Investment Recommendations • Risk Profiling: 6-question psychometric quiz (inspired by SEBI's investor suitability framework) generates a Conservative / Moderate / Aggressive profile stored in the user model. • Recommendation Engine: Collaborative filtering model (Surprise library, open-source) trained on anonymized investment behavior data combined with content-based filtering on fund attributes. Recommends: Direct Mutual Funds (via MF API from MFAPI.in — free), Digital Gold (via MMTC-PAMP public API), NSC/PPF/Sukanya Samriddhi (Government schemes, static data). • SIP Calculator: Visual SIP calculator with AI-generated plain-language explanation of compounding ('If you save ₹500/month for 10 years at 12%, you'll have ₹1,16,000. That's your child's first year of college fees.'). • Zero-Commission Direct Funds: The platform links directly to AMFI (Association of Mutual Funds in India) registered fund houses via their public APIs. No commissions, no middlemen.
 • Zero-Commission Direct Funds: The platform links directly to AMFI (Association of Mutual Funds in India) registered fund houses via their public APIs. No commissions, no middlemen.2.1.6  Financial Literacy Hub • Bite-sized daily lessons (2–3 minutes) on financial topics: What is inflation? How does EMI work? What is CIBIL score? Content generated by the fine-tuned LLM, reviewed by advisors. • Lessons adapt to the user's learning pace. If a user doesn't engage with a topic for 3 days, the AI sends a WhatsApp/SMS nudge (via Twilio free tier or MSG91). • Quiz system with streak rewards. Completing 5 lessons unlocks a 'Financial Health Certificate' shareable on LinkedIn. • Audio mode: All lessons available as text-to-speech using Coqui TTS (open-source, Mozilla Public License). Critical for low-literacy users.2.1.7  Document Vault • Encrypted storage for PAN card, Aadhaar (last 4 digits only, tokenized), salary slips, bank statements, insurance policies. • Documents are encrypted client-side using AES-256-GCM before upload (Web Crypto API in browser, Expo SecureStore on mobile). • AI auto-extracts key fields from uploaded documents and pre-fills forms (KYC, loan applications).2.2  Financial Advisor — Feature SetFinancial Advisors are verified professionals (NISM-certified or NGO-affiliated counselors) assigned to cohorts of 50–200 users. Their RBAC permissions are read-heavy; all write actions require explicit user consent stored as a time-limited consent token.2.2.1  Advisor Dashboard • Cohort Overview: Glass-card grid showing all assigned users with a color-coded financial health score (0–100, computed by the ML health scoring model described below). Red = critical intervention needed, Yellow = at-risk, Green = on-track. • Financial Health Score Model: Multi-feature regression model (XGBoost) trained on features: savings rate, debt-to-income ratio, emergency fund coverage, investment diversification, spending volatility, and goal adherence. Output is a 0–100 score with plain-language explanation. • Alert Queue: AI surfaces users who need immediate attention — e.g., 'User X has not made any transactions in 15 days (possible income loss)' or 'User Y has exceeded their food budget for 3 consecutive months.' • Bulk Communication: Send personalized financial tips to the entire cohort. The AI personalizes the template for each user based on their profile (income, goals, risk level) before sending via WhatsApp/SMS.2.2.2  User Detail View (With Consent) • Full spending breakdown, savings trajectory, and investment portfolio — all in the same glass-morphic UI as the user's view, but with an additional advisor annotation layer. • Advisor can leave time-stamped notes on a user's profile (not visible to the user unless shared). • Suggested Action Panel: AI generates 3 ranked intervention suggestions for each user the advisor is viewing ('Suggest an emergency fund goal', 'Recommend SIP amount reduction given recent income dip', 'Flag potential EMI overload').
 • Suggested Action Panel: AI generates 3 ranked intervention suggestions for each user the advisor is viewing ('Suggest an emergency fund goal', 'Recommend SIP amount reduction given recent income dip', 'Flag potential EMI overload').2.2.3  AI Co-Pilot for Advisors • The same fine-tuned Mistral LLM serves the advisor but with a different system prompt granting access to aggregated anonymized cohort insights. • Advisor can ask: 'What is the most common financial mistake in my cohort this month?' or 'Which users are closest to their savings goals and could benefit from a motivational nudge?' • AI drafts personalized action plans for individual users that the advisor reviews and approves before delivery.2.2.4  Educational Content Curation • Advisors can create custom lesson modules for their cohort using a block-based editor (similar to Notion). • AI suggests relevant content blocks based on the cohort's common financial pain points detected in the past 30 days. • Content goes through an admin review queue before publishing.2.3  Partner Institution — Feature SetPartner Institutions (banks, MFIs, NGOs, government schemes) can integrate with FinSaathi via a secure API to offer their products/services to matched users. Their RBAC access is limited to anonymized aggregate data and their own API endpoints. They cannot access individual user PII.2.3.1  Product Listing & Matching • Partners list financial products (microloans, insurance, savings accounts, government schemes) via a structured form in the Partner Portal. • FinSaathi's recommendation engine matches products to users based on eligibility criteria (income, location, credit score tier, employment type) without sharing user PII with the partner. • Matching uses a privacy-preserving federated scoring approach: the eligibility check runs on FinSaathi's servers and returns only a binary match/no-match signal to the partner.2.3.2  Aggregate Analytics Dashboard • Partners see aggregated, k-anonymized (k≥50) analytics about their matched user cohort: income distribution histogram, geographic heat map (district level, not village level), product uptake funnel. • All analytics are computed using differential privacy (Google's DP library, open-source) before serving to partners. No query can reconstruct an individual. • Partners can request A/B tests for their product messaging, run by FinSaathi's admin team.2.3.3  API Integration Suite • REST API with OAuth 2.0 (PKCE flow) for partner authentication.
 • REST API with OAuth 2.0 (PKCE flow) for partner authentication. • Webhooks for real-time events: user_matched, user_applied, user_onboarded. • Sandbox environment with synthetic data for integration testing. • API rate limiting per partner tier enforced via Redis token bucket.2.4  Admin — Feature SetAdmins are platform operators. Admin access requires mandatory hardware TOTP 2FA (FIDO2/WebAuthn via open-source SimpleWebAuthn library). All admin actions are logged to an immutable audit trail stored in an append-only PostgreSQL table with row-level checksums.2.4.1  User & Role Management • Full CRUD on user accounts, advisor assignments, and partner onboarding. • Role assignment uses casbin policy management UI — admins select subject, resource, and action from dropdowns; raw policy strings are never manually edited. • Bulk user import via CSV for partner-onboarded cohorts (e.g., an NGO uploads a list of 500 beneficiaries).2.4.2  Model Monitoring & Retraining • MLflow (open-source) dashboard embedded in the admin panel. Shows model performance metrics: recommendation click-through rate, chat satisfaction score (thumbs up/down), categorization accuracy, savings goal completion rate. • Data drift detection using Evidently AI (open-source). Alerts admin when the distribution of incoming transaction data deviates significantly from training data, triggering a retraining pipeline. • One-click retraining: Admin triggers a Celery background job that pulls fresh data, fine-tunes the model using PEFT/QLoRA, evaluates on a holdout set, and if performance improves, deploys the new weights to Ollama.2.4.3  Content Moderation & Quality Control • All AI-generated financial advice is logged. A secondary classifier (fine-tuned on Indian financial regulation compliance rules) flags potentially non-compliant advice for human review. • Advisor-created content sits in a review queue before publishing. Admin can approve, edit, or reject. • Abuse detection: Unusual API call patterns from partner accounts trigger automatic rate-limit escalation and alert to admin.2.4.4  Platform Analytics • Real-time dashboard built with Apache Superset (open-source) showing: DAU/MAU, feature adoption heatmap, average financial health score over time, savings mobilized (aggregate ₹), investment recommendations accepted. • Cohort analysis to measure long-term impact: Do users who engage with the Financial Literacy Hub improve their savings rate within 90 days? • Exportable reports for impact reporting to investors, government bodies, and grant applications.
